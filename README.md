## Credits

Woodstock Golf club have an old website which the members find hard to navigate. The information is not clearly laid out and some details about the club are hidden in different pages on the site and are hard to find.

I read through the information on the existing Woodstock Golf Club site. I used the information from the site to display the club story and information about the club more clearly, its location and beautiful surrondings.

I also used the exisitng webite to gather information about the dress code and green fees for vistors and a 
breakdown of the fees.
