Our Club
Founded in 1988, Woodstock is an 18-hole golf course on 155 acres of beautiful fairways and greens. Nestled in the beautiful rolling countryside of Ennis, Co. Clare, the river, natural lake, mature woods  and contours of the land have been used to great effect to produce a test of skill and shot making for players of all handicaps.
The beautiful scenery will give pleasure to golfers and is not too far from the Wild Atlantic Way.
There is a Golf shop on site and locker & shower facilities.
